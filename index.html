With a corncob pipe and a button nose and 
two eyes made out of coal 

Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say 
He was made of snow but the children know 
how he came to life one day 

There must have been some magic in that old 
silk hat they found For when they placed it on 
his head he began to dance around 

Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play 
just the same as you and me 

Thumpetty thump thump thumpety thump thump 
Look at Frosty go 
Thumpetty thump thump thumpety thump thump 
Over the hills of snow 

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day 
So he said "Let's run and we'll have some fun now 
before I melt away" 

Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand 
Running here and there all around the square saying 
Catch me if you can 

He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop 
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler "Stop!" 
For Frosty the snow man had to hurry on his way 
But he waved goodbye saying "Don't you cry"
I'll be back again some day`

All of the other reindeer (reindeer) 
Used to laugh and call him names (like pinnochio) , 
They never let poor Rudolph (rudolph) 
Join in any reindeer games, (like monopoly) 

Then one foggy Christmas Eve, 
Santa came to say, ho ho ho, 
Rudolph with your nose so bright, 
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight? (tonight) 

Then how the reindeer loved him (loved him) 
As they shouted out with glee, yippee,

He pretends that I am Murphy Brown. 
He'll say, "Are you ready?" 
I'll say, "Whoa, Man!" "Let's wait until our wives are out of town!"

Later on, if you wanna,
We can dress -- like Madonna, 
Put on some eyeshade, And join the parade,

And the lights are turned way down low.
Let it Flow, Let it Flow, Let it Flow!! 

When we finally drink it dry, 
how we hate going back to the store. 
Maybe we'll just get high, 
and all fall asleep on the floor!!

                                    SantaCon began in San Francisco in 1994, inspired by a 1974 Danish activist theatre group called Solvognen, who gathered dozens of "Santas" in Copenhagen to hand out items from department store shelves as "presents" before being arrested.

                                    Staged as street theater by the San Francisco Cacophony Society—a counterculture group focused on pranks and subversive art—the first event was called "Cheap Suit Santas" and aimed to make fun of Christmas consumerism. Originally influenced by the Surrealist movement and Discordianism, it wasn't intended to be a recurring event, but returned in 1995 with 100 participants.

                                    SantaCon spread rapidly: Portland in 1996, Seattle in 1997, and Los Angeles and New York in 1998. The rise of the internet and the website Santarchy.com helped advertise the event, allowing people around the world to bring it to their cities. Today, SantaCon takes place in hundreds of cities globally, though it has evolved significantly from its countercultural roots into the festive pub crawl we know today.

                                    Boulder SantaCon launched in 2006 with a simple mission: instead of fighting crowds at the mall on Black Friday, why not dress up as Santa and celebrate the holidays in the most ridiculous way possible? It was a subtle protest against consumerism wrapped in cheap red suits and holiday cheer.

                                    The first few years were beautifully chaotic. We started with about 20 Santas "shopping" at the 29th Street Mall, much to the confusion of mall security. We'd take the HOP bus downtown, which became known as "Santa's Sleigh." Dozens of Santas would cram in like festive sardines while bewildered commuters laughed and took photos. One year, a pop-up speakeasy called "Santa's Pub" appeared, serving cold PBR's, hot chocolate, and peppermint schnapps to thirsty Santas.
