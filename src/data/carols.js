        title: "Frosty the Snowman",
        lyrics: `Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul 
With a corncob pipe and a button nose and 
two eyes made out of coal 

Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say 
He was made of snow but the children know 
how he came to life one day 

There must have been some magic in that old 
silk hat they found For when they placed it on 
his head he began to dance around 

Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play 
just the same as you and me 

Thumpetty thump thump thumpety thump thump 
Look at Frosty go 
Thumpetty thump thump thumpety thump thump 
Over the hills of snow 

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day 
So he said "Let's run and we'll have some fun now 
before I melt away" 

Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand 
Running here and there all around the square saying 
Catch me if you can 

He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop 
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler "Stop!" 
For Frosty the snow man had to hurry on his way 
But he waved goodbye saying "Don't you cry"
I'll be back again some day`

        title: "Jingle Bells",
        lyrics: `Dashing through the snow 
In a one horse open sleigh 
O'er the fields we go 
Laughing all the way. (ho, ho, ho!) 
Bells on bob tails ring 
Making spirits bright 
What fun it is to laugh and sing A sleighing song tonight 

Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells 
Jingle all the way 
Oh, what fun it is to ride 
In a one horse open sleigh 

Jingle Bells, Batman smells Robin laid an egg. 
The Batmobile lost a wheel and the Joker got away (Hey!) 

Jingle bells, shotgun shells, 
Santa Claus is dead, Rudolf got a .22 and shot him in the head. (Hey!) 

Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells 
Jingle all the way 
Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one.... horse.... open.... SLEIGHHHHH!!!!!!!`

        lyrics: `You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen, 
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen., 
But do you recall? The most famous reindeer of all! 

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (reindeer) 
Had a very shiny nose, (shiny nose) 
And if you ever saw it, (saw it) 
You would even say it glows (like a light bulb!), 

All of the other reindeer (reindeer) 
Used to laugh and call him names (like pinnochio) , 
They never let poor Rudolph (rudolph) 
Join in any reindeer games, (like monopoly) 

Then one foggy Christmas Eve, 
Santa came to say, ho ho ho, 
Rudolph with your nose so bright, 
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight? (tonight) 

Then how the reindeer loved him (loved him) 
As they shouted out with glee, yippee, 
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, (reindeer) You'll go down in history!`

It's the best time of the year 
I don't know if there'll be snow but have a cup of cheer 

Have a holly, jolly Christmas

Say Hello to friends you know and everyone you meet 

Oh ho, the mistletoe hung where you can see 
Somebody waits for you 
Kiss her once for me 

Have a holly jolly Christmas 
and in case you didn't hear 
Oh by golly have a holly jolly Christmas this year`

        lyrics: `Lacy things -- the wife is missin', 
Didn't ask -- her permission,
I'm wearin' her clothes, Her silk pantyhose, 
Walkin' 'round in women's underwear. 

In the store -- there's a teddy, 
Little straps -- like spaghetti, 
It holds me so tight, Like handcuffs at night, 
Walkin' 'round in women's underwear. 

In the office there's a guy named Melvin, 
He pretends that I am Murphy Brown. 
He'll say, "Are you ready?" 
I'll say, "Whoa, Man!" "Let's wait until our wives are out of town!"

Later on, if you wanna,
We can dress -- like Madonna, 
Put on some eyeshade, And join the parade, 
Walkin' 'round in women's underwear!

Lacy things... missin', 
Didn't ask... permission, 
Wearin' her clothes, Her silk pantyhose, 
Walkin' 'round in women's underwear, 
Walkin' 'round in women's underwear, 
Walkin' 'round in women's underwear!`

The weather outside is frightful, 
but the beer inside's delightful. 
And since we've no place to go,
Let it Flow, Let it Flow, Let it Flow! 

Oh we show no signs of stopping, 
and now we're really hopping. 
And the lights are turned way down low.
Let it Flow, Let it Flow, Let it Flow!! 

When we finally drink it dry, 
how we hate going back to the store. 
Maybe we'll just get high, 
and all fall asleep on the floor!! 

Oh the party is slowly dying. 
And our friends have all stopped buying. 
Now my bladder really wants to know. 
Where to go, Where to go, Where to go???`
